# CaesarCracker
This Python script is designed to decrypt ciphertexts encrypted with the Caesar cipher. It tries all 26 possible shifts to find the one that produces a valid English sentence. It uses the Natural Language Toolkit to verify the decrypted text by checking if it contains a sufficient proportion of valid English words.
